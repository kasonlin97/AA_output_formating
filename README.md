The four files correspond to the respective outputs from AmpliconArchitect and AmpliconClassifier. Only the graph.txt file and the cycle.txt file are of my interest. Since both files were output in a non-tabulated form, the codes serve to turn each file output into a more friendly-working tabulated output (in .csv). Users can handle downstream analysis by opening the .csv files in excel.
